    },
    {
        title: Interpreted,
	    subject: Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.
    },
    {
        title: High Performance,
	    subject: With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.
    },
    {
        title: Distributed,
	    subject: Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.
    },
    {
        title: Dynamic,
	    subject: Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.
